# The Theoretical Minimum: Handwritten Notes

Welcome to my handwritten notes for Professor Leonard Susskind's **Theoretical Minimum** series. This series, hosted by Stanford University, covers essential concepts in physics and is an introductory course to fundamental theories like classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and more. These notes summarize each lecture and serve as a concise resource for students and enthusiasts of physics.

## About This Project

These notes were taken from the lectures found in Professor Susskind's **Theoretical Minimum** series on YouTube. You can watch the lectures [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJfw6lDlTuA&list=PL701CD168D02FF56F).

### Project Highlights

- **54 Pages of Handwritten Notes**: All major concepts and derivations from each lecture are detailed in a compact format.
- **Complete Lecture Coverage**: Each lecture is summarized with an emphasis on key ideas, derivations, and formulas.
- **Accessible to Beginners**: While advanced topics are covered, notes are structured to help beginners grasp foundational concepts.

## How to Use These Notes

1. **Self-Study**: These notes can serve as a study guide for learners working through the Theoretical Minimum series.
2. **Quick Reference**: Topics are organized to make it easy to find key derivations, equations, and physical laws.
3. **Supplemental Resource**: If you are following along with the video lectures, use these notes as a recap of the essential concepts from each lecture.
